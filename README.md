A Rostock (delta 3D printer) fork build in Vienna 

A lot of chnages have bin made and all files were rewritten form scratch!

The changes in detail:

* Optimised carriage: Better bandholder, better LMXXUU holder
* Added a System to tighter the band very easy
* Add a joint system based on Ballbearings


Its still work in progess!
